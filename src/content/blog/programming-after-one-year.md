description: My journey and thoughts on programming, the online tech space, and life in general after one year of Coding
---

I've been coding for a bit over a year now, and over this rollercoaster of a year I've learned a lot. I've also taken many paths, some of which I jumped off, some of which I had to walk back on and some of which I'm still crawling along.

## Table of contents

## Java... Script?

My first programming language was JavaScript, and as one might expect this had a lot of influence over the rest of my programming journey.
Learning JavaScript determined the first few tech youtubers I watched and the channels I went to in search of the ultimate "learn JavaScript in one video" video. I still have a youtube playlist of 8+ hour videos that claim to teach you all you need to know about JavaScript - I might as well delete that playlist because I'm never watching those videos to the end.

There was one video I finished though. It was [Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg) on the freeCodeCamp youtube channel. It managed to cram the basics of JavaScript into me and I was able to start making basic JavaScript programs and using JavaScript to build webpages.

Next I built some simple projects using [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevsimplified) tutorials.
I'll say the only reason these were useful to me is because of the type of learner I am. After watching and following along the tutorial, I didn't stop there. I always made sure to try and build the tutorial project again but without watching the video, only referecing a part of the video when I was stuck or didn't understand something.
This helped to cull some wrong assumptions or correct misunderstandings I got from the initial build of the tutorial project. It also allowed me to put my own spin on things and develop a _relatively_ deeper understanding of what I was doing.

Somehow I moved from making simple websites and browser games to building websites that made use of APIs.
I built a simple weather app, as all JS devs do, and I gained some understanding of how REST APIs work - and like every noob, I had my API key in my code as a variable.

At this point, I was already learning git and Github putting all my projects in repositories of their own and slowly understanding the importance of version history.

I had done some frontend challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and had gotten some tips to improve my use of semantic HTML and CSS. Because Frontend Mentor requires you to host your code, on Github Pages for example, I had to learn a bit about that. As a beginner, I was super excited how easy it was to make a "website" I had made available for others to see and use.

I believe I also used [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) a bit.

## freeCodeCamp.org

From the freeCodeCamp video, I learnt about [their website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and I started with their HTML/CSS course, to refresh on my knowledge and update myself on any changes, which was definitely useful because I learnt so much more about HTML and CSS than I had when I first learnt it about 5 years ago now.
Then I took their JavaScript course, which was basically the same as the youtube video they had, but reading the chapters and following it all also exposed some things to me.

After the doing the JavaScript again, and completing the projects, I move on to their React course. At the time, it was still class components and function components had already become the norm (which I didn't know). However, this was not a waste at all. To this day, I believe my understanding of react class components helped me transition to function components faster and with a better overall understanding of react.

Just btw, I remember there was a time I tried to run react locally, setting it up myself LOL. I read so many articles, tried so many things, but just couldn't get it to work. I 100% did not understand what I was doing. I was bombarded with stuff about babel and webpack and node_modules and and and I had no idea what any of those were. So I stuck to doing the react lessons on freeCodeCamp.

## Deez Nodes

Node... node... node. I had unknowingly been using NodeJS for a while, but I first became conscious of it when I came across it in the list of things I'd be taught in a coding bootcamp a friend recommended.

I was told that I'd be able to get a coding job after doing that bootcamp, but I AM STILL CODING JOBLESS. Anyways, I chose the fullstack track for the bootcamp because I already had a good idea about basic frontend, but thought I could always learn something from a professional teaching me, and I also wanted to learn backend.

So I joined the bootcamp and the frontend classes were so disappointing and in no way challenging. I learnt absolutely nothing from the frontend classes. But the backend classes, although not challenging either, laid the foundation for teaching me NodeJS. They explained somethings to us, which allowed me to kickstart my self learning journey of NodeJS. I used replit for a while, before setting up node on my machine. I had already become somewhat familiar with the window terminal and of course, I was using git bash. So I setup node, and before long I dove into backend things - not very deep though.

I learnt how to build simple APIs with ExpressJS, and how to build simple CRUD apps with MongoDB. I experimented a lot with that and also did freeCodeCamp's nodejs lessons. The excitment was intoxicating. I felt like I could build anything with my new backend powers.
So... of course I tried. I attempted chat apps, social media apps and the likes. Each time encountering new problems and obstacles like socket.io for web sockets and actually getting users - I have none :(.

## LeetCode Warrior

Everyone knows if you want a programming job, you need to be able to leetcode.
I had heard about this early into my journey and I had been attempting leetcode challenges almost every day since I learnt javascript basics.
Describing this now, one could say I basically threw myself into the deep end of DSA because I had no idea what I was doing at the start.
I don't think I was even able to solve "two sum", yep it was terrible. But I didn't give up, I forced myself to learn simple data structures.
And luckily for a JavaScripter like me, JS has data structures like Arrays, Maps and Sets built in - although I didn't know about Maps and Sets until much later.
I leetcoded a lot, motivated my keeping my streak alive, I always attempted the daily problem. The focus there is attempted.
Because I certainly didn't always solve it. I'll be honest though and say sometimes I copied solutions from others :D.

I'm thankful for my leetcode era though. It forced me to have a deeper understanding of programming in general. Like memory and Big O. Which lots of people who have been programming, especially mostly with JavaScript, as long as me still struggle with.

## This is CS50

"This is CS50", these words were the start to leaps in my programming journey. At first I was super skeptical when the lessons started with scratch, but now CS50 is my recommendation to beginners looking for a programming starting point.

CS50 taught me how the code I write really works and also taught me how to write C good. I really only did the first 3 lessons. But those alone were super valuable to my programing journey. I don't have too much to say about it except that if want to start programming, start at CS50.

## ~~Java~~TypeScript

I started learning TypeScript on Codecademy and it was a bit tough at first, but once I got the hang of it, writing code became so much better. I started doing my leetcode challenges in TypeScript as well. I was writing backends with TypeScript. Everything became TypeScript.

I started learning TypeScript around the time I had just learnt React, so I did a little course on using the both together and I jumped straight in. I never really wrote any React application with just React, it was always with TypeScript.

Some of my peers complained about TypeScript's complexity saying that JavaScript was simply better, but since I started using it TypeScript has always been my first choice. I felt so accomplished using TypeScript. I built fullstack applications, many of which I never finished, but I learnt so much along the way.

I spent about 4 months using no other programming language but TypeScript.

## Hacktoberfest

Before TypeScript came [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com). I had so much fun with it and now the stickers are all over my laptop.

Thanks to hacktoberfest I was able to experience what it's like to work with other devs and collaborate in Github repositories. I forked and cloned code, I solved merge conflicts and I made pull requests. At the time it was all really hard stuff and very hard to wrap my head around, but I'm grateful I stuck through it all.

## Dev-Twitch

Where do I even start with this one. Just watch it (source: trust me bro).

But seriously, being on twitch has been an immeasurable boost to my programming journey. I've written [a post](/posts/new-devs-and-twitch) about this already but in summary, watching and actively chatting in the "Software and Developer" category on twitch has allowed me to meet many interesting and knowledgeable people that have helped guide me on my programming journey.

You can find many examples of what you should (and shouldn't) be doing as programmer on dev-twitch. And you can always find motivation and/or guidance in form of a streamer who is willing to look at or talk to you about your code.

That said, it's easy to be misguided being on dev-twitch, so make sure to be careful and do your own research on any information you're given.

I plan to start streaming someday and help others they way I've been helped on dev-twitch.

## To SQL or to NoSQL

Becoming a developer these days is tuff as there as so many opinions out there and barely have enough experience to form your own.

SQL vs NoSQL is an example of that. To put it simply, I don't care. As a broke dev learning backend, I'll say use anyone that is easiest for you to host for free. MongoDB has Atlas, MySQL has planetscale and you could probably do any in a docker container leeching off some PaaS's free tier, but for that you'd need to know Docker.

Understanding databases is definitely an important skill to learn, that path I took was don't care too much about which one and just learnt it, which for me was MongoDB. Although now I'm also pretty comfortable with SQL databases as well - using an ORM that is, prisma ftw.

## I'm Multilingual

After some time, one begins to wander, "What else lies beyong the JavaScript horizon?".
Sure enough, I went beyong the horizon and found "paradise".

Rust, Golang, C/C++. I'm learning the three, my favourite of which is Golang. To me, Go feels like C (which I love a lot) plus JS/TS, which makes it really comfortable for me.
Rust can be very enjoyable but sometimes I feel like my brain has to do so much gymnastics just to write a simple rust program.

Recently, I've been experimenting with using Raylib in those three languages. And it's been most enjoyable in Golang I'd say.

I will say this, learning to understand how programming languages might interact with the computer system is much more important than learning the specific syntax of a language, because it become easy to pivot from language to language. And at the end of the day, if you know what to do, but not how to do it, a simple google search or question to GPT can easily help there. However if you don't know what to do at all, then you're in for a pickle.

## Linux? I thought that's for hackers

Sometime around March of this year, I decided to try out linux. The reason wasn't actually because of programming.
At the time my very old laptop which I referred to as the potato-top was become increasingly slow, so I moved from windows 10 to [tiny 11](https://archive.org/details/tiny-11-NTDEV), which is simply a smaller and strip down version of windows 11. And sure enough, it brought about speed changes to my laptop - also fixed some issue the laptop had, but we won't go into that.

While on tiny 11 and enjoying my dev experience, I decided to learn Docker. It was while trying to get Docker to work on tiny 11 that I find out that the stuff tiny 11 strips out includes what Docker needs to run on windows. So with my new found OS switching powers, I decided to try out linux.

It was better for devs anyways and I'd have to learn more than just bash commands at some point. And one of my favourite dev-twitch streamers had just made the Windows-to-Linux switch at the time, so I decided to use the same distro - Kubuntu.

Since it was an older computer, with a lot of issues, I had to do a lot of troubleshooting and trial and error - which included changing some BIOS settings - before I could install and actually run Kubuntu. At some point, I just had no operating system on the laptop, with what I thought was a broken ISO on the bootable usb drive I had. Needless to say I was pretty scared.

Aside from the initial installation issues, my move to linux was easy. I was already familiar with a lot of the terminal commands from using git bash and I had done a linux course on freeCodeCamp. There was also a lot more GUI than I was expecting, although now I mostly live in the terminal ;).

Even after my move to linux, my docker adventures were prohibited by potato-top's 4GB RAM.

Since then, I've moved from Kubuntu to Pop!\_OS and finally to Fedora - on a new laptop that can actually run Docker.

## Editor wars

With my move from windows to linux came my move from VS code to neovim.

This was not the first time I had tried a modal editor.
Back on windows, I had tried out [Helix-Editor](https://helix-editor.com) and I love it, the only reason I moved back to VS code before commiting to Helix is because of the way it shows buffer diagnostics - really long diagnostics end up covering some of the code.

Anyways, this means it was pretty easy to understand the concept of modal editing in Neovim, and I was able to get started easily with [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org), an IDE layer for neovim.

In no time, I got pretty used to moving around with vim way and I became super comfortable using neovim, so much so that using VS code was almost alien to me.

## I'm a Web Developer

Although I have no such job, I'd definitely call myself a web developer.

I've been become more comfortable with docker and containerizing applications, and making them production ready. Also, I've decided to start properly planning applications before hand to speed up the development process overall. I think these are skills that one would need to call themselves a developer, aside from actually writing code.

I still have no idea what "Function Programming" or "Object Oriented Programming" might be. Neither do I know how to properly use Github Actions. But I'm getting there, better to move slow and steady than to not move at all.

I'll probably do another of these at the 2 year mark. Excited to compare my experience then to now and to look at my old code and go "Eww... did I really write that!?".
